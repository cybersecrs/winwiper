# Win-Wiper
**One-Click-Wipe** _all folder data on Windows machines_

## About

WinWiper is simple tool to wipe data in single directory. It's created from [AFINUS Project](https://github.com/cybersecrs/afinus), but without aditional options you have when executing script from source.  

I am currently working on GUI for [AFINUS](https://github.com/cybersecrs/afinus), and I got some errors and troubles during development.  I decided to make a small demo, just to check how it work, and then I found it useful for Windows users.

## Why it could be useful

WinWiper doesn't require any installation, just download and execute app. With 9 overwrites per file, you're sure it's destroyed. Process of cleaning files will be shown in command prompt during execution, and will exit at the end. WinWiper will start after double-click, and that's it. I will continue on developing AFINUS, and I will do my best to create a nice GUI for this gem, including Windows App.
