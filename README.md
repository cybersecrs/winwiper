# Win-Wiper
**One-Click-Wipe** _all folder data on Windows machines_

## About

WinWiper is simple tool to wipe data in single directory. It's created from [AFINUS Project](https://github.com/cybersecrs/afinus), but without aditional options you have when executing script from source.  

I am currently working on GUI for [AFINUS](https://github.com/cybersecrs/afinus), and I got some errors and troubles during development.  I decided to make a small demo, just to check how it work, and then I found it pretty useful for Windows users.

## Why it's good

WinWiper doesn't require any installation, just download and execute app. With 9 overwrites per file, you're sure it's destroyed. Process of cleaning files will be shown in command prompt during execution, and will exit at the end. WinWiper will start after double-click, and that's it! All your files in that folder are gone, forever, even for professionals.

WinWiper is written in Ruby language, use only core functions + `gem 'colorize'` for nice terminal output. I will continue on developing AFINUS, and I will do my best to create a nice UI for this gem, including Windows UI App.

# DONATE!

I will add more repositories during the day/night, with *plan* and addresses for donations. Each donation will be anonymous and transparent, and all money will be shared between developers. If you have special wish about some software, contact me and I will do my best to create it for you, as long as you place donation (doesn't matter how much).d
