# Win-Wiper
One-click-wipe all files in folder for Windows machines

This is .EXE file for Windows, created from [AFINUS](https://github.com/cybersecrs/afinus) gem.  
I am working on GUI with all functions, and since I have some errors, I wanted to try in this way, and works perfect. Files from directory will be wiped, but your app will stay there. Keep in mind that your files will be overwritten 9 times, so you'll not be able to recover them, be careful.

WinWiper has been created with OCRA gem.
